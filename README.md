# PressBoard

**PressBoard** is a web‑based PCB design tool for creating 3D‑printable circuit boards with copper tape channels and modular enclosures. It combines intuitive layout, intelligent auto‑assembly, and real‑time 3D visualization to make solder‑free electronics design accessible to makers, educators, and rapid prototypers.

## ✨ Key Features

### User Interface
- Responsive three‑panel layout with component library, design canvas, and inspector panel
- Real‑time 3D preview with orbit controls, section plane, and exploded view
- Dark mode, keyboard shortcuts, and built‑in tutorials for ease of use

### Board Design
- Parametric board shapes: rectangular, circular, or freeform
- Adjustable dimensions and thickness with presets (Arduino, small, medium, large)
- Mounting holes, magnet recesses, and press‑fit features for enclosures

### Component Library
- 100+ footprints across 25 categories: passives, semiconductors, headers, switches, ICs, MCUs, displays, audio, sensors, motors, and more
- Drag‑and‑drop placement with grid snapping, rotation, and search
- Auto‑generated designators (R1, C1, U1, etc.) and annotations

### Routing
- Multiple routing modes: manual, Manhattan, spline, and auto‑router with obstacle avoidance
- Tape‑aware constraints: selectable widths (3–8 mm), bend radius enforcement, U/V/flat channel profiles
- Two‑sided board support with vias and pad clearance checks

### Auto‑Assembly
- Intelligent placement engine with multiple layout strategies (grid, compact, symmetric, flow, radial)
- Connection‑aware auto‑routing with quality scoring and optimization
- Wizard workflow: select → connect → arrange → preview

### Design Rule Checks
- Comprehensive DRC: spacing, wall thickness, bend radius, pad clearance, overlap detection, unconnected pads, power validation
- Inline violation markers and one‑click auto‑fix suggestions

### 3D Enclosure Integration
- Lid designer with dimension controls, pressure pad generation, and magnet polarity indicators
- Automatic enclosure geometry aligned to component pads
- STL export for lids and substrates, with assembly guides

### Export & Assembly
- STL export for 3D printing
- SVG/DXF tape mask templates
- PDF assembly guide with step‑by‑step instructions
- Factory package (ZIP) including all files and BOM

### Project Management
- Save/load projects as JSON
- Undo/redo history
- Project sharing and collaboration ready
- Static hosting compatibility (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel)
